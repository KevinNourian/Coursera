    "#  Introduction\n",
    "Tilto, Inc. is a Lithuanian education and technology company, registered in the United States. Tilto is planning to create a company with Coursera as a model. Coursera was founded by Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng in 2012 with a vision of providing life-transforming learning experiences to learners around the world. Today, Coursera is a global online learning platform that offers anyone, anywhere, access to online courses and degrees from leading universities and companies. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Lithuanian, Tilto means bridge. The company plans to create a bridge between citizens of the world and their human potentials. Tilto plans to become an international company that impacts the world by making its citizens realize their innate potentials. Tilto's leaderhip wishes to understand what makes Coursera successful. They also want to know what can be done better, so Tilto can become an even stronger organization than Coursera. For this analysis, I will work with a dataset provided by Coursea and obtained from Kaggle to help Tilto, Inc. achieve its vision."
